### December 2020 Experiment
Hold code for DEC 2020 WM Experiment

### FSC Output Transform

#### RUN IT
1. clone to `your/dir/`
2. Should only need `pip install pandas`
3. `cd your/dir/FSC/convert_output/`
4. Run `python3 FSC_collapse.py`
5. Two files will be written to the `results` folder

Notes:
  - In the files folder, there is an excel checker used to verify results; there are discrepancies but all are decimal dust.
  - All of the csv files in the `fsc_output_files` folder are what Dr. Puma provided us in slack
